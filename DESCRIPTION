Description: Provides tools for multilevel descriptive statistics and data decomposition.
    Computes within-group and between-group correlations, intraclass correlation 
    coefficients (ICCs), and comprehensive descriptive statistics tables for nested data. 
    Supports both frequentist (via lme4) and Bayesian (via brms) estimation approaches.
    Includes functions for decomposing variables into within-group and between-group 
    components for use in Random Effects Within-Between (REWB) models.
